[YAWS](https://sudoku.nxn.io) is a progressive Sudoku puzzle app that hopes to create a unified user experience across
multiple device types. It is able to generate and solve challenging puzzles in a consistent manner via the use of 
[Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org) for its core code.

The project is currently in an early stage of development with the goal of incorporating robust features such as 
customizable keyboard controls, saving and sharing game states, hints, and more.

A prototype build is available for viewing at: [sudoku.nxn.io](https://sudoku.nxn.io)
