# VS Code Remote: WSL + SSH Agent Forwarding

<br />

<Summary>

A step by step guide for configuring tools necessary to develop remotely with Visual Studio Code over SSH. The
documented setup enables connections to standard Windows environments as well as Windows Subsystem for Linux
distributions. In addition, it also shows how to configure SSH Agent Forwarding for connecting to services like GitHub
without having to store copies of privates keys or enter passphrases.

</Summary>

The code and scripts within this guide should be treated as reference only -- I do not advise executing anything without
first fully understanding the intention and also verifying that proper modifications have been made to adapt it to your 
specific system and needs.

## Windows Host SSH Configuration and Key Setup
The first things we want to do is setup OpenSSH on Windows, generate keys for the host machine and/or any clients that 
will be using it remotely, and glue it all together.

1.  Install **OpenSSH Client** & **OpenSSH Server**
    -   Settings > Apps & Features > Optional Features
    -   Search for "OpenSSH"
    -   Ensure Client and Server are installed

2.  SSHD Configuration requirements: open `%programdata%/ssh/sshd_config` and ensure the following are configured as
    follows:
    -   `PasswordAuthentication no` (can be left enabled, but doing so reduces the security benefit of using pubkey
        authentication)
    -   `PubkeyAuthentication yes` (default)
    -   `AllowAgentForwarding yes` (default)
    -   `AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys` (default)
    -   If any of the accounts you will be using when connecting to the Windows Host have administrative priveleges you
        will either need to comment out the following setting, or be required to designate remote access for those users
        through the global `administrators_authorized_keys` file. With the default configuration, user owned
        `authorized_keys` files are ignored for administrators.
        ``` bash
        #Match Group administrators
        #       AuthorizedKeysFile __PROGRAMDATA__/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys
        ```

3.  Start **OpenSSH Server** and **OpenSSH Agent** services and set them to start automatically:
    ``` PowerShell
    PS> Set-Service sshd -StartupType Automatic
    PS> Start-Service sshd

    PS> Set-Service ssh-agent -StartupType Automatic
    PS> Start-Service ssh-agent
    ```
    or via GUI by running (Win+R) `services.msc`

4.  Generate passphrase protected ssh-keys for the Windows host and any client systems that will be connecting to it
    (ideally you should do this locally on each machine so that later you only need to transfer public keys over):
    ``` PowerShell
    PS> cd ~/.ssh
    PS> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"

    > Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
    > Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
    ```

5.  Restrict security permissions for the created `id_ed25519` private keys:
    -   Windows Host and/or Clients: 
        -   Right click > Properties > Security Tab > Advanced
        -   Click `Disable Inheritance`
        -   Select `Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object.`
        -   Remove any entries that are not `SYSTEM`, the `Administrators` group, or **your own user account**
        -   See ["User private key files"](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-Win32-OpenSSH#user-private-key-files)
            for more details
          
    -   POSIX Clients: Ensure ownership is restricted to your own account and the file permissions are set to **0600**, to
        change either you can use something like the following:
        ``` bash
        # Set 'username' as owner
        $ chown username:username ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

        # Set file permission to -rw-------
        $ chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```

6.  Let each machine's `ssh-agent` handle the private keys; on linux clients you may need to use something like 
    `keychain` if your Desktop Environment or distribution doesn't automatically start `ssh-agent` for you and/or
    doesn't provide any compatible alternatives.
    ``` PowerShell
    # List available keys (not required, but useful to confirm before proceeding)
    PS> ssh-add -L

    # Add the generated key
    PS> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```
    **Note:** On Windows machines it is recommended to move and store the private key off of the machine after it has 
    been added to the SSH Agent service as the file itself is no longer necessary for the agent to operate. On Linux and
    other OSes it may be necessary to keep the private key on the machine depending on the key storage mechanism being
    used -- classic ssh-agent implementations are transient and only maintain added keys for the lifetime of their
    process. 

7.  Set Git for Windows to use the Windows *OpenSSH Client* (by default Git for Windows uses its own bundled ssh package
    that is unaware of the Windows `ssh-agent` service):
    ``` PowerShell
    PS> git config --global core.sshcommand "C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe"
    ```

8.  Ensure the Windows Host's public key has been added to GitHub -- [instructions for adding keys](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
    You may wish to also add the client public keys if you would like to use them to connect to GitHub directly.

9.  Verify everything up to this point is working correctly by authenticating with GitHub from the Windows Host and from
    any of the clients you intend to use directly. You should not be required to enter your passphrase if `ssh-agent` is
    working as expected.
    ``` PowerShell
    PS> ssh -T git@github.com

    > Hi <Account Name>! You've successfully authenticated, ...
    ```

10. Import client public keys into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (or `%programdata%/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys` if
    the host account you'll be using is designated as an admin and you want to keep the default configuration scheme).
    The following import scripts are copied from [VSCode's documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting)
    and will only work for modifying the user owned 
    `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
    -   Remote Unix-like client:
        ``` bash
        $ export USER_AT_HOST="your-user-name-on-host@hostname"
        $ export PUBKEYPATH="$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

        $ ssh $USER_AT_HOST "powershell New-Item -Force -ItemType Directory -Path \"\$HOME\\.ssh\"; Add-Content -Force -Path \"\$HOME\\.ssh\\authorized_keys\" -Value '$(tr -d '\n\r' < "$PUBKEYPATH")'"
        ```
        **Note:** The above did not work as expected in my case -- the generated `authorized_keys` contained malformed
        characters. I suggest double checking the file after it is created or simply performing this step manually.

    -   Remote Windows client:
        ``` PowerShell
        PS> $USER_AT_HOST="your-user-name-on-host@hostname"
        PS> $PUBKEYPATH="$HOME\.ssh\id_rsa.pub"

        PS> Get-Content "$PUBKEYPATH" | Out-String | ssh $USER_AT_HOST "powershell `"New-Item -Force -ItemType Directory -Path `"`$HOME\.ssh`"; Add-Content -Force -Path `"`$HOME\.ssh\authorized_keys`" `""
        ```

    -   Alternatively, either use `ssh-id-copy` or manually insert the public key into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` 
        yourself:
        ``` bash
        ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/client_public_key.pub your-user-name-on-host@hostname
        ```

11. Restrict security permissions for `authorized_keys`:
    -   Right click > Properties > Security Tab > Advanced
    -   Click `Disable Inheritance`
    -   Select `Convert inherited permissions into explicit permissions on this object.`
    -   Remove any entries that are not `SYSTEM`, the `Administrators` group, or **your own user account**
    -   See ["authorized_keys"](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-Win32-OpenSSH#authorized_keys)
        for more details.
    
    If using the `administrators_authorized_keys` file, its permissions should only allow access by `SYSTEM` and the
    `Administrators` group; inheritance should be disabled. See ["administrators_authorized_keys"](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-Win32-OpenSSH#administrators_authorized_keys)
    for specifics.

12. With everything configured you should be able to `ssh` into your Windows Host from all of your clients.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Windows Host WSL Configuration
The objective here is to setup a mechanism that will route the WSL ssh-agent communication over to the `ssh-agent`
running on the Windows Host. To do this, a few tools are going to be required:

1.  Install `socat` in the WSL distro (assuming Debian/Ubuntu):
    ``` bash
    sudo apt install socat
    ```

2.  Download [npiperelay](https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay/releases) and put `npiperelay.exe` under the Windows 
    portion of the file system. You can then symlink it to some location that's visible to your WSL's *PATH* environment
    variable.
    ``` bash
    $ wget https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay/releases/download/v0.1.0/npiperelay_windows_amd64.zip
    $ unzip npiperelay_windows_amd64.zip
    $ mv npiperelay_windows_amd64/npiperelay.exe /mnt/c/Users/[USER]/bin/npiperelay.exe
    $ sudo ln -s /mnt/c/Users/[USER]/bin/npiperelay.exe /usr/local/bin/npiperelay.exe
    ```

3.  Add the following to your `~/.bashrc`, sources: [stuartleeks.com](https://stuartleeks.com/posts/wsl-ssh-key-forward-to-windows/)
    and [rupor-github](https://github.com/rupor-github/wsl-ssh-agent#wsl-2-compatibility).
    ``` bash
    # Route SSH Agent Forwarding to Windows Host's ssh-agent
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$HOME/.ssh/agent.sock
    ss -a | grep -q $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        rm -f $SSH_AUTH_SOCK
        (setsid socat UNIX-LISTEN:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK,fork EXEC:"npiperelay.exe -ei -s //./pipe/openssh-ssh-agent",nofork &) > /dev/null 2>&1
    fi
    ```

4.  Verify that you are able to authenticate to GitHub from your WSL distro when on the Windows Host and when connected
    via SSH from a client:
    ```bash
    $ ssh -T git@github.com

    > Hi <Account Name>! You've successfully authenticated, ...
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Client Configuration
The last tricky part is to create two Host configurations for the Windows Host on each client. These will be mapped
within VSCode to the standard Windows environment and the other to the WSL distro, allowing you the option of which
specific environment you want to connect to for remote development.

1.  Create two entries for the Windows host in the client's `~/.ssh/config`. Note that the second one's name is appended
    with `-wsl` (the suffix is not important so long as the two names are different), otherwise they should be
    identical.
    ```
    Host [ID or name used for connecting]
        HostName        [A hostname or LAN ip]
        User            [your username on the host]
        IdentityFile    ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ForwardAgent    yes

    Host [ID or name used for connecting]-wsl
        HostName        [A hostname or LAN ip]
        User            [your username on the host]
        IdentityFile    ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ForwardAgent    yes
    ```

2.  Ensure proper permissions are applied to `~/.ssh/config`:
    -   For Windows: similar to before, disable permission inheritance and restrict access to only allow `SYSTEM`, the
        `Administrators` group, and **your own user account**; See ["ssh_config"](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-Win32-OpenSSH#ssh_config)
        for more information.
    -   For POSIX: ensure ownership is restricted to your own account and the file permissions are set to 0600:
        ``` bash
        # Set 'username' as owner
        $ chown username:username ~/.ssh/config

        # Set file permission to -rw-------
        $ chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/config
        ```

3.  Install the VSCode `Remote - SSH` extension.

4.  Edit VSCode's `settings.json` file and add the following JSON. This will map the Host to the desired platform so
    that when connecting you will be able to specify if you want the regular windows environment or the WSL environment
    contained within it. 
    ``` json
    "remote.SSH.remotePlatform": {
      "[ID or name of windows host]": "windows",
      "[ID or name of windows host]-wsl": "linux"
    },
    "remote.SSH.useLocalServer": false
    ```

5.  On the Windows Host you may want to install the `Remote - WSL` extension if you wish to develop using the local WSL
    distro. 

6.  You should now be able to establish a remote VSCode connection from any of your clients to your Windows Host's
    standard environment or its WSL environment. From there you should also be able to authenticate with services like
    GitHub without needing to provide any passphrases or needing to keep copies of private keys.
