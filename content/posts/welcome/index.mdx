# Hello and Welcome

<Summary>

This website is a little project that I've been working on for the last few weeks. Initially, it was intended to serve 
as a quick showcase of my recent work, however, I came to the realization that I would also like to occasionally 
document and share insights regarding development and the technologies I work with. To that end, I will be updating the
site on a periodic basis with my findings. 

</Summary>

As an example of the type of content that will be coming in the future, here's a brief overview of 
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), the site's design, and a thank you to some of the projects that this site depends 
on.

## On Gatsby

This was my first experience with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and overall I think it's pretty close to the 
ideal tool for building portfolio style websites. In case you're not familiar, at its core Gatsby is a static site
generator — it allows you to point to a source of content, write some [React](https://reactjs.org/) components for it, 
and compile the mixture into browser-food. Of course, ontop of this it also comes with tools for pre-fetching, 
lazy-loading, code splitting, image optimization, etc.

Though what I personally liked the most about it is that it gives you a solid starting point for your website or web
application. I typically tend to set everything up manually since I've never really managed to find a starter template
that had everything I wanted configured to my liking. Plus, every time that I have used one, I eventually found 
myself tearing through config files to figure out why something that I just added refused to cooperate with everything
else. Essentially, I value having the understanding of how everything fits together after having built it myself piece
by piece.

The difference with Gatsby is that it already comes with a ton technologies that have been integrated and configured to
work well with each other. In fact, I suppose you could break Gatsby down and claim that fundamentally it is a mixture
of React SSR, GraphQL, Webpack, Reach/React-Router, Babel, Sharp, and many other components. But really the key for me 
is how well all of these parts are integrated out of the box. There's nothing that immediately stands out as being its 
own disntict entity. In fact, by default most of the pieces are kept out of sight, so you probably wouldn't even know 
that they were there unless you've worked with them before.

## On The Design

I wanted this website to feel somewhat unique so I chose to create my own design instead of using any pre-made themes or
templates. At the time of writing, I do not consider it to be finished — it's more along the lines of being functional 
enough to serve as a foundation for things that I'll be gradually adding on to it in the future. In that regard, I am 
pretty happy with it thus far; it adapts well to various screen and text sizes and, although somewhat basic, it leaves a
lot of freedom towards content presentation.

While on the subject of designs and visuals, I'd like to give some attention to [unDraw](https://undraw.co/) for 
creating an amazing collection of open-source graphics. They offer a comprehensive library of customizable vector-based 
illustrations that are created for websites and applications. They are free for use in both commercial and 
non-commercial projects, featuring a very non-restrictive [license](https://undraw.co/license). All the images found in
this post originally came from unDraw, though I have modified them a bit to better fit the website's theme.
