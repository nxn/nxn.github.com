# Welcome

<br />

<Summary>

**Hello and welcome** — this website is a little project that I've been working on for the last few weeks. Initially, it was
intended to serve as a quick showcase of my recent work, however, I came to the realization that I would also like the
ability document and share any insights regarding development and technology. To that end, I will be updating the site 
on a periodic basis with my findings. 

</Summary>

As an example of the type of content that will be coming in the future, here's a brief overview of 
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), creating the site, and other miscellaneous things.

## Gatsby, The Great

This was my first experience with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and overall I think it's pretty close to the 
ideal tool for building portfolio style websites. In case you're not familiar, at its core Gatsby is a static site
generator — it allows you to point to a source of content, write some React components for it, and compile the mixture
into browser-food. Of course, ontop of this it also comes with tools for pre-fetching, lazy-loading, code splitting, 
image optimization, etc.

Though what I personally liked the most about it is that it hid Webpack out of my sight. That's not to say that I don't
like Webpack or what it does, just that I typically find working with it to be somewhat frustrating. The source of my 
pain usually involves having a mountain of various plugins and loaders that often don't mix well with some finer detail 
of the overall system that I would like to have in place. So while I know that webpack is one of the core components of 
Gatsby, I am grateful that thus far Gatsby has managed to encapsulate it to the point that I don't even need to know
it's actually there.

Gatsby does this pretty well in general. While you could break Gatsby down and claim that fundamentally it is simply a 
mixture of React SSR, GraphQL, Webpack, Reach/React-Router, Babel, Sharp, etc, the overall package has been composed 
well and feels cohesive. That same frustration I typically get as a result of needing to work with an overabundance of 
third party tools thankfully doesn't exist here.

## The Design

When I picture other websites in the developer blog / portfolio category, I typically think of a handful of premade blog
themes — the ones that are mostly white and minimalistic, or the other end of the spectrum, where every pixel on the
page has a chance of triggering some action or animation. I mostly wanted to avoid going too far down either path so I 
just have a basic layout and a somewhat funky color scheme.

The colors were initially based on a terminal theme that I've been using for the last 10 years, but as the tweaks and
changes added up the end result doesn't really have much of a resemblence to the original anymore.
