# Hello and Welcome

<Summary>

This website is a little project that I've been working on for the last few weeks. Initially, it was intended to serve 
as a quick showcase of my recent work, however, I came to the realization that I would also like to occasionally 
document and share insights regarding development and the technologies I work with. To that end, I will be updating the
site on a periodic basis with my findings. 

</Summary>

As an example of the type of content that will be coming in the future, here's a brief overview of 
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), the site's design, and a thank you to some of the projects that this site depends 
on.

## Gatsby

This was my first experience with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), and overall I think it's pretty close to the 
ideal tool for building portfolio style websites. In case you're not familiar, at its core Gatsby is a static site
generator — it allows you to point to a source of content, write some [React](https://reactjs.org/) components for it, 
and compile the mixture into browser-food. Of course, ontop of this it also comes with tools for pre-fetching, 
lazy-loading, code splitting, image optimization, etc.

Though what I personally liked the most about it is that it will give you a solid starting point for your website or web
application. In the past, I would typically set everything up myself because there usually isn't an ideal starter app 
that contains all the things I want included. You could pick one that's closest to what you're after, but there is still 
a good chance that you will eventually find yourself tearing through config files to figure out why the tool you just 
added refuses to cooperate with everything else. I've been there, and it's why I typically prefer to develop an 
understanding of how everything fits together by building it myself piece by piece.

The difference with Gatsby is that it already comes with a ton technologies that have been integrated and configured to
work well with each other. In fact, I suppose you could break Gatsby down and claim that fundamentally it is a mixture
of React SSR, GraphQL, Webpack, Reach/React-Router, Babel, Sharp, and many other components. But really the key for me 
is how well all of these parts are integrated out of the box. There's nothing that immediately stands out as being its 
own disntict entity. In fact, by default most of the pieces are kept out of sight, so you probably wouldn't even know 
that they're there unless you've worked with them before or require direct control over them for some specific task.

## The Design

When I picture other websites in the developer blog / portfolio category, I typically think of a handful of pre-made
themes — the ones that are mostly white and minimalistic; or the other end of the spectrum — where every pixel on the
page has a chance of triggering some action or animation. I mostly wanted to avoid going too far down either path so I 
just have a basic layout, a somewhat funky color scheme, and a little fun with content presentation on a few of the
pages.

I structured the design and styles in a way that should make creating themes relatively straightforward, so I may
include theme settings at some point in the future. As it stands, the current color scheme was actually inspired by a 
terminal theme that I've been using for roughly the last 10 years; though in retrospect, after a lot of tweaks and 
changes the end result doesn't really have that much in common with the original.

There's still a lot more that I'd like to do with regards to the look and feel of the site. While I'm generally not a 
fan of drastic design changes, I do plan on revising a few things in the near future.
