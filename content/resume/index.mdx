## Experience

<article>

### YAWS
#### Project Owner & Developer *(May 2020 – present)*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developed a progressive web application for generating and solving sudoku puzzles through the use of TypeScript, Rust,
React, and HTML5 APIs such as Web Assembly, Web Workers, and Local Storage. The application is capable of running
completely within any modern browser environment and does not require a server side connection after the initial load. 

##### Accomplishments

-   Developed core logic using the Rust programming language for consistent and improved performance in comparison to
    similar JavaScript implementations. 
-   Integrated with Webpack to leverage asset and dependency management, code splitting, content hashing, and build
    automation.
-   Used TypeScript along with React and Material UI to create a responsive user interface that has the ability to
    fluidly scale between low resolution and UHD displays. The user interface also fully supports both desktop and
    mobile environments.

### AnyAxis
#### Project Owner & Developer *(Jan 2015 – present)*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AnyAxis is a cross-platform device driver that enables various Inertial Measurement Unit devices to be used as an
alternative input method when interacting with desktop applications. Its goal is to provide an improved user experience
in areas such as accessibility, customization, and 3d interaction.

##### Accomplishments

-   Used Rust, along with principles of data-oriented design, to create a generic device model capable of representing
    various input mechanisms, such as: physical buttons, analog inputs, touchpads, touchscreens, gyroscopes, and
    accelerometers.
-   Designed and implemented a data agnostic architecture that enables device support across various protocols such as
    USB, HID, and Bluetooth.
-   Utilized asynchronous IO to create a stream based input processing pipeline. The pipeline enables devices to be
    multiplexed, re-mapped, and output as other device types, without incurring any overhead from multithreading.

### Intertrust Group
#### Developer *(Apr 2011 – Oct 2014)*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Responsible for the development and maintenance of Intertrust's Client Portal — a C# ASP.NET website encompassing tools
for helping clients manage their corporate structure. Primary duties included: making the site operate as efficiently as
possible, ensuring reliable integration with internal systems, designing flexible solutions for jurisdiction dependent
requirements, and implementing features to help both Intertrust’s clients and administrators alike. 

##### Accomplishments

-   Created a fully automated build, packaging, and deployment system using C#, MSBuild and TeamCity. The system was
    also capable of digitally signing generated packages to ensure that they could only be extracted and installed in
    environments for which they were intended.
-   Constructed ASP.NET RESTful web services to allow independent document management systems to maintain control of
    documents on the portal.
-   Helped re-style the website to match Intertrust's theme while also improving the site visually.
-   Implemented a new .NET Membership-Provider to improve security by enforcing stricter authentication procedures. The
    Membership-Provider also added safer lock-out logic to prevent denial of service attacks and upgraded the mechanism
    used for securely storing sensitive client information.
-   Leveraged D3.js to create an interactive diagram for visualizing relationships between entities and individuals.
-   Improved site performance by optimizing code and incorporating tools such as non-relational databases.

business needs. Other responsibilities included providing user support and troubleshooting errors. 

##### Accomplishments

-   Worked in both individual and group environments to design, implement, and maintain multiple AJAX based applications
    for Sabre's corporate intranet website.
-   Helped redesign Sabre's internal website to accommodate hosting richer and more dynamic web based applications.
