Issues:
-   [safari] OSD fullscreen mode: swiping down triggers exit fullscreen gesture (generated frame doesn't set no-scroll?)
-   Fix button clicks so that scaling doesn't cancel click event
-   ToC: Glitchy on hot module reload

Roadmap:
-   Improve instructions and wording on vscode_remote
-   Snackbar
    -   Unique constraint
    -   Use Hideable HoC for animations
