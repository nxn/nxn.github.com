[YAWS](https://sudoku.nxn.io) is a progressive Sudoku puzzle app that hopes to create a unified user experience across
multiple device types. It is able to generate and solve challenging puzzles in a consistent manner via the use of <a

The project is currently in an early stage of development with the goal of incorporating robust features such as 
customizable keyboard controls, saving and sharing game states, hints, and more.

A prototype build is available for viewing at: [sudoku.nxn.io](https://sudoku.nxn.io)
