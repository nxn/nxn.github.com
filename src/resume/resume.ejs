                        Developed a progressive web application for generating and solving sudoku puzzles through the
                        use of TypeScript, Rust, React, and HTML5 APIs such as Web Assembly, Web Workers, and Local
                        Storage. The application is capable of running completely within any modern browser environment 
                        and does not require a server side connection after the initial load.

                            Developed core logic using the Rust programming language for consistent and improved
                            performance in comparison to similar JavaScript implementations.

                        <li>
                            Used TypeScript along with React to create a responsive user interface that has the ability
                            to fluidly scale between low resolution and UHD displays. The user interface also fully
                            supports both desktop and mobile environments.

                        AnyAxis is a cross-platform device driver that enables various Inertial Measurement Unit devices
                        to be used as an alternative input method when interacting with desktop applications. Its goal 
                        is to provide an improved user experience in areas such as accessibility, customizability, and 
                        3d interaction.

                        <li>
                            Used Rust, along with principles of data-oriented design, to create a generic device model 
                            capable of representing various input mechanisms, such as: physical buttons, analog inputs, 
                            touchpads, touchscreens, gyroscopes, and accelerometers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Designed and implemented a data agnostic architecture that enables device support across
                            various protocols such as USB, HID, and Bluetooth.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Utilized asynchronous IO to create a stream based input processing pipeline. The pipeline
                            enables devices to be multiplexed, re-mapped, and output as other device types, without
                            incurring any overhead from multithreading.

                        Responsible for the development and maintenance of Intertrust's online Client Portal — specifically:
                        making the site operate as efficiently as possible, ensuring reliable integration with internal 
                        systems, designing flexible solutions for jurisdiction dependent requirements, and consistently 
                        implementing new features that help both clients and administrators alike.

                        <li>
                            Created a fully automated build, packaging, and deployment system using MSBuild and TeamCity. 
                            The system was also capable of digitally signing generated packages to ensure that they could 
                            only be extracted and installed in environments for which they were intended.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Constructed RESTful web services to allow independent document management systems to maintain 
                            control of documents on the portal.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Implemented a new Membership-Provider to improve security by enforcing stricter authentication 
                            procedures. The Membership-Provider also added safer lock-out logic to prevent denial of service
                            attacks and upgraded the mechanism used for securely storing sensitive client information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Leveraged D3.js to create an interactive diagram for visualizing relationships between entities
                            and individuals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Improved site performance by optimizing code and incorporating tools such as non-relational
                            databases.

                        <li>
                            Helped re-style the website to match Intertrust's theme while also improving the site visually.
