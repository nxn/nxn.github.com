      This resume was created with the intent to test out upcoming features of
      HTML5 related standards -- primarily the canvas element. With that in mind,
      this website will not function in web browsers which do not have an
      implementation of such standards. Furthermore, certain effects may cause
      a noticable slow down in browsers that do not have a modern JavaScript
      engine. If this is the case, please feel free to download the
      <a href="ewieczorek.pdf">PDF version of this resume</a>.
