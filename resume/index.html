The application is capable of running completely within any modern browser environment and does not require a server side connection after the initial load.</p><h5>Accomplishments</h5><ul class="bullet-list columns"><li>Developed core logic using the Rust programming language for consistent and improved performance in comparison to similar JavaScript implementations.</li><li>Integrated with Webpack to leverage asset and dependency management, code splitting, content hashing, and build automation.</li><li>Used TypeScript along with React and Material UI to create a responsive user interface that has the ability to fluidly scale between low resolution and UHD displays. The user interface also fully supports both desktop and mobile environments.</li></ul></article><article><header><h3>AnyAxis</h3><h4>Project Owner &amp; Developer <span class="date">(Jan 2015 – present)</span></h4></header><p>AnyAxis is a cross-platform device driver that enables various Inertial Measurement Unit devices to be used as an alternative input method when interacting with desktop applications. Its goal is to provide an improved user experience in areas such as accessibility, customization, and 3d interaction.</p><h5>Accomplishments</h5><ul class="bullet-list columns"><li>Used Rust, along with principles of data-oriented design, to create a generic device model capable of representing various input mechanisms, such as: physical buttons, analog inputs, touchpads, touchscreens, gyroscopes, and accelerometers.</li><li>Designed and implemented a data agnostic architecture that enables device support across various protocols such as USB, HID, and Bluetooth.</li><li>Utilized asynchronous IO to create a stream based input processing pipeline. The pipeline enables devices to be multiplexed, re-mapped, and output as other device types, without incurring any overhead from multithreading.</li></ul></article><article><header><h3>Intertrust Group</h3><h4>Developer <span class="date">(Apr 2011 – Oct 2014)</span></h4></header><p>Responsible for the development and maintenance of Intertrust's Client Portal — a C# ASP.NET website encompassing tools for helping clients manage their corporate structure.
