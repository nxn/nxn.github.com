                    <p>
                        Responsible for the development and maintenance of Intertrust's online Client Portal — specifically:
                        making the site operate as efficiently as possible, ensuring reliable integration with internal 
                        systems, designing flexible solutions for jurisdiction dependent requirements, and consistently 
                        implementing new features that help both clients and administrators alike.

                    <ul class="bullet-list columns">
                        <li>
                            Created a fully automated build, packaging, and deployment system using MSBuild and TeamCity. 
                            The system was also capable of digitally signing generated packages to ensure that they could 
                            only be extracted and installed in environments for which they were intended.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Constructed RESTful web services to allow independent document management systems to maintain 
                            control of documents on the portal.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Implemented a new Membership-Provider to improve security by enforcing stricter authentication 
                            procedures. The Membership-Provider also added safer lock-out logic to prevent denial of service
                            attacks and upgraded the mechanism used for securely storing sensitive client information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Leveraged D3.js to create an interactive diagram for visualizing relationships between entities
                            and individuals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Improved site performance by optimizing code and incorporating tools such as non-relational
                            databases.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Helped re-style the website to match Intertrust's theme while also improving the site visually.
